  <blockquote>
    <p>The short version is: “fun way to say we need more dense urban housing”, but for the long version:</p>

    <p>The Kowloon Walled City was a legal-grey-area turned cyberpunk refugee city in Hong Kong that held the record for the densest populated region in the world until it was demolished in 1994:</p>

    <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KWC_-_1989_Aerial.jpg">alt=”An aerial photo of the Kowloon Walled City taken in 1989. Organic masses of 1-story buildings clump and cluster tin a dense agglomeration, leaving shafts for air and light and a central chasm. The city is surrounded by a barren park and several skyscrapers which are sterilely rectangular in comparison.”</a> — <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KWC_-_1989_Aerial.jpg">1989 aerial photo of Kowloon Walled City by Ian Lambot</a>, used under a Creative Commons <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License</a>.</p>

    <p>Its density clocked in at 1.93 million/km^2 - for comparison, Tokyo, for example, clocks in at 16,121.8/km^2, and is one of the denser modern cities on earth.</p>

    <p>And the point is that the Kowloon Walled City was <em>good</em>. Like oh sure it was an ungoverned crime syndicate drug palace contorted into existence by the apathy or open hostility of the surrounding nation-states, but that’s not the fault of its city layout; its residents were better off having the city than not having it. Evidence is spotty but from what we have building safety was equal to that of the rest of Hong Kong, residents regarded it fondly, no major negative health effects occurred, and rents were far far cheaper.</p>

    <p>We can of course do far far better than Kowloon; but the Kowloon Manifesto is the idea that modern societies are insanely afraid of population density for no reason. Many societies today - particularly the United States &amp; Canada, though they are not alone - contort their urban landscapes against density, fostering car dependence, decayed public transport, and skyrocketing housing prices. Why we do so is very complex, but the end result is almost uniformly bad economically, socially, and environmentally. These policies are based on false and often self-serving justifications that don’t match the reality of life in actually-dense urban localities.</p>

    <p>If you gave me the ability to snap a Kowloon into existence in the US today, I would easily do so - I can definitely do <em>better</em> as mentioned, its completely unnecessary to go this extreme, but faced with only that binary its an easy choice. For America the Kowloon Walled City is the utopian dream our desultory status quo can only aspire to, and the Kowloon Manifesto holds that virtually every step closer to that dream is one we should take.
