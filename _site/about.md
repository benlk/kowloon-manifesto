# About this site

This site is inspired by [a post from tumblr user centrally-unplanned](https://web.archive.org/web/20220624035228/https://centrally-unplanned.tumblr.com/post/684016869875843072/hey-asking-if-you-could-please-clarify-what-you).

This site is adapted from centrally-unplanned's tumblr posts, with a generous helping of others' work. Where possible, sources are cited.

This site is not affiliated with centrally-unplanned; it probably operates without their knowledge.

This site has a distinctly American bent because that's where the maintainer currently lives.
