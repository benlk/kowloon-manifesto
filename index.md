> We can of course do far far better than Kowloon; but the Kowloon Manifesto is the idea that modern societies are insanely afraid of population density for no reason. Many societies today - particularly the United States & Canada, though they are not alone - contort their urban landscapes against density, fostering car dependence, decayed public transport, and skyrocketing housing prices. Why we do so is very complex, but the end result is almost uniformly bad economically, socially, and environmentally. These policies are based on false and often self-serving justifications that don’t match the reality of life in actually-dense urban localities.

> If you gave me the ability to snap a Kowloon into existence in the US today, I would easily do so - I can definitely do *better* as mentioned, its completely unnecessary to go this extreme, but faced with only that binary its an easy choice. For America the Kowloon Walled City is the utopian dream our desultory status quo can only aspire to, and the Kowloon Manifesto holds that virtually every step closer to that dream is one we should take.

## The Kowloon Manifesto
{: .fit}

- We need more dense urban housing
- Modern societies are afraid of population density
- They have no good reason to be afraid
- Kowloon Walled City was very dense, and that was good
- The United States should do all they can to densify

## Corollaries of the Manifesto
{: .fit}

An agenda of radical growth
: Environmental justice, democratization, self-sufficiency, local government, self-sufficiency, and openness can be accomplished while growing the economy and population. It exists in opposition to degrowth agendas.[^17]

Make your city dense _today_
: Not in fifty years. Not in 20 years. Not in 10 years. Remove obstacles to density as fast as possible. Buy up empty lots of land, upzone them, and get rich by selling condos or apartments.

Build up, not out
: Density is measured in people per square mile. Spreading people out horizontally makes the density number go down. Keeping people confined to ground level means they have no personal space. The only way to space people out while keeping density is to space people out vertically. The best way to do that is by building taller buildings.

Remove zoning barriers to density
: The major obstacle to dense housing is that it's illegal. This kind of smart, walkable, mixed-use urbanism is illegal to build in most American cities.[^18] Let's make it legal.

Colocate transit and housing
: Don't surround your transit stations with unwalkable moats of parking lots. Build housing and jobs right next to the transit stations.[^7] Make it easy for everyone to walk to work.

Don't need a car if walking is easy
: If the place you're going to is a five-minute walk away, you don't need a car. A handcart is enough to carry all but the heaviest of items. You can walk to the grocery store and push your shopping cart home. You can walk to the doctor, or roll your wheelchair, or ride your bike, or push your kid in a stroller. You can walk to pick your children up from school. You can walk to pick up your grandfather's meds from the pharmacist. _Your half-blind grandfather can walk to pick up his own meds._

Make cars unnecessary
: Cars take up space. Car roads can't be used by pedestrians, wheelchair users, stroller-pushers, shopping carts, or by the most-efficient peoplemover known to humankind: the train. Cars take up space when they're moving and when they're stopped. Cars take up so much space.[^11] In areas with good transit, you do not need a car. And when you don't need a car, that space can be used for something else.

Unnecessary cars means better land use
: If you don't need a car, you don't need a spot to park a car. And that means you can use that space for things like restaurants, parks, schools, libraries, gyms, axe-throwing ranges, benches, bars, laundromats, public restrooms, bathhouses, combination bars and axe-throwing ranges, churches, churches sharing space with pool rooms, swimming pools, travel agencies, more housing &mdash; really anything else that isn't parking.[

Don't build parking garages
: Parking garages are lazy solutions to the problem of cars. Build jobs and housing and stores colocated in the same building, so people don't need to own a car.[^8]

There are alternatives to cars
: Walking. Scooters. Bicycles. Unicycles. Electric bicycles.[^10] Mopeds. Taxi. Bus. Tram. Metro. Train. Aeroplane. If you build alternatives to cars, you induce demand for alternatives to cars, and people will use these alternatives.[^13]

Just ban cars
: Banning cars will make your main streets much nicer, and will cause no problems.[^9] People prefer to live in car-free cities, anyways.[^12] And once you've started considering banning cars, you can think about the impacts of cars on society.[^15]

Build more housing so it costs less
: It's basic economics: When supply increases and demand remains the same, the price declines until demand rises to meet it.[^14]

Land values go up when you build dense
: A half-acre lot with a four-bedroom house on it can be rented out as one dwelling unit. A half-acre lot with ten stories of four-bedroom houses on it can be rented out as ten dwelling units, in total earning more in rent than the one-bedroom house.

Density is good for the environment
: Transit is more environmentally friendly than single-person cars, yeah. But you know what's also environmentally friendly? Sharing a wall with your neighbors. It's one more surface that heat can't leak across. One more exterior wall you don't have to heat in the winter. One more exterior wall you don't have to cool in the summer.

Density supports functional transit
: The easiest way to pay for transit is through fares charged by riders. The more riders per route-mile, the more fare revenue you get. Don't remove a low-ridership transit line. Upzone around it so that the number of riders will increase.

Better transit means less traffic
: Fewer people driving cars means fewer cars in traffic. The Netherlands has the best public transit and is also the best place to drive a car.If you like driving your car, you'll like living in a place with less competition for the road.[^6]

Density makes strong cities
: More density means more tax revenue per square mile. Concentrating the population in fewer square miles means fewer linear miles of infrastructure like water and sewer and roads. Density lowers upkeep costs, while increasing money available to do upkeep.[^5]

In many cities, taking a bicycle is often the fastest way to get somewhere, because cyclists can usually take the shortest and most-direct route, while drivers need to take the long way around. You might think that this is bad for drivers, but it's not, because if cycling wasn't faster, many of these people would be in cars.

The answer, again, is yes, you can." The article goes on to talk about housing in Tokyo, where new supply is outpacing population growth, leading to decreased cost of housing. Chicago and Montreal are also densifying, and remain more affordable than peer cities. Singapore is an example of publicly-owned hosing. Germany is an example of national-scale privately-owned housing. They're building more housing, and so housing is affordable. For a counterexample, see San Francisco, which has built so little new housing that it's the most-expensive place to live in the US, where full-time employees of major employees are either homeless or commute hours to live someolace affordable.
